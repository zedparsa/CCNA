## ⚡ About
A repository built during my **CCNA journey** ⚙️.  
It contains both:
- **`labs/`** → Practical scenarios, configs, and topologies.  
- **`learn/`** → Notes & explanations I figured out (like teaching while learning).  

This repo is not just for practice – it’s a **personal hacking-style notebook** 🕶️.
